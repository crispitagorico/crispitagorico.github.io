I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/) at Imperial College London, faculty member of [Imperial X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/), and visiting researcher at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a [Chapman Fellow](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/research/opportunities/chapman-fellowships/) in Mathematics and before that a PhD student in the [DataSig Team](https://datasig.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) supervised by [Prof. Terry Lyons](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/terry.lyons).

Research Interests
------
I am interested in generative differential equation models and associated autodifferentiable numerics. I am also interested in machine learning techniques for biological and financial signal processing. My research has mainly focused on:

- Neural SDEs, score-based diffusion models, state-space models.
- Spiking neural networks, reservoir computing.
- Neural operators, neural (stochastic) PDE solvers.
- Signature kernel methods for biological and financial signal processing.

I am the Imperial PI of the Innovate UK Grant [Quantum Machine Learning for Financial Data Streams](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=10073285) investigating how to perform computations of signature transforms more efficiently on quantum hardware.
